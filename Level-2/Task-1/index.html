                <h3 class="about-text">About Nambi Narayanan</h3>
                <p class="hidden">Nambi Narayanan was born on December 12, 1941, in Nagercoil, Tamil Nadu, India.</p>
                <p class="hidden">He showed an early aptitude for science and engineering, which led him to pursue a degree in mechanical engineering from Madurai University.</p>
                <p class="hidden">His academic prowess earned him a NASA fellowship, which allowed him to study at the prestigious Princeton University in the United States, where he specialized in chemical rocket propulsion.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Upon returning to India, Narayanan joined the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) in 1966.</p>
                <p class="hidden">This technology was crucial for ISRO's ambitious plans to develop indigenous satellite launch vehicles.</p>
                <p class="hidden">He quickly became a key figure in India's burgeoning space program, contributing significantly to the development of liquid propulsion technology.</p>
                <p class="hidden">He led the team that developed the Vikas engine, which became a core component of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) and the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV).</p>
                <p class="hidden">In 1994, Narayanan's illustrious career took a dramatic turn when he was falsely accused of espionage.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Narayanan was arrested and subjected to harsh interrogation, which caused significant personal and professional distress.</p>
                <p class="hidden">The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) took over the case and concluded that the charges against Narayanan were false and fabricated.</p>
                <p class="hidden">In 1996, the Supreme Court of India dismissed all charges against him. Despite his vindication, Narayanan's fight for justice continued as he sought to hold those responsible for his wrongful arrest accountable.</p>
                <p class="hidden">In 2018, the Supreme Court awarded him compensation for the mental agony and suffering he endured and directed the Kerala government to pay him â‚¹50 lakh.</p>
                <p class="hidden">The court also ordered an investigation into the role of the police officers who had falsely implicated him.</p>
                <p class="hidden">Narayanan's perseverance and dedication to his field were eventually recognized at the highest levels.</p>
                <p class="hidden">In 2019, he was awarded the Padma Bhushan, one of India's highest civilian honors, for his contributions to the Indian space program.</p>
                <p class="hidden">His life story has also inspired a biographical film, which highlights both his scientific achievements and the injustices he faced.</p>
